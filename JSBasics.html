            <h2>JavasScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers  to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside of a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <div class="links">Variable Declaration</div> JavaScript variaables are containers for storing data values- imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, aa variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="code">var x</span></li>
                <li><div class="links">Variable Assignment</div>Assignment centers assign values to JavaScript Variables- our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = Assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="code">var x=10</span></li>
                <li><div class="links">Data Types</div>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean= <span class="code">True</span> or <span class="code">False,</span> null = <span class="code">null</span> aka nothing; Number = <span class="code">42</span> or <span class="code">3.14159;</span> String =<span class="code">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Arraay = <span class="code">[1, "Coding", 2, "dojo"]</span> and Object = <span class="code">{firstName: "Jane",lastName:"Doe"}</span></li>
                <li><div class="links">Conditionals</div>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditionals that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this There are the following conditional statements: <span class="code">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="code">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false, <span class="code">else</sppan> we execute this block of code;</li>
                <li><div class="links">Loops</div>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentiallyy do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                <li><div class="links">Function</div>Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from IKEA, we open up the manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
